Welcome to the course website for the class **"Large Langugae Models: Implications for linguistics, cognitive science and society"!**

In this course we will take a step towards understanding the multi-faceted effects that the release of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT and GPT-4 has on our lives. We will discuss important topics in philosophy of cognitive science and linguistics and how these disciplines are affected by the release of LLMs. We will also address the socio-political shift due to LLMs, as well as cover technical foundations of LLM architectures and applications.
